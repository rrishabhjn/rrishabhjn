## 🔧 What I Do

I’m a **hands-on Product Manager** who thrives at the intersection of **AI, cloud infrastructure, developer platforms, and cybersecurity**. I've crafted intuitive, enterprise-scale user experiences, from first prototype to global GTM, serving millions of customers across Microsoft Azure.

My default mode is: _think deeply, ship fast, and iterate purposefully_.

### Notable Highlights

- 🧠 **AI x Infra:** Designed a GenAI-powered recovery assistant at **Microsoft Azure**, which became a blueprint for **Azure Co-Pilot**, enhancing recovery workflows across the cloud platform.
- ☁️ **Cloud PM Craft:** Led the $XM+ **Azure Backup & Site Recovery** business - growing new markets, shipping new products, Ransomware Protection, and platform-wide unification. Watch me [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPa6FPj0Qrs)
- 🔐 **AI-Security Strategy:** At **Jump Capital**, authored a landscape paper on [**Securing GenAI**](https://jumpcap.com/insights/securing-gen-ai/) and [**Modern Data Stack**](https://jumpcap.com/insights/data-through-the-modern-ai-system-the-new-ml-data-stack/), identifying market opportunities at the intersection of LLMs, Data, cybersecurity, and DevSecOps.
- 🧰 **Tinkerer at Heart:** I build automation workflows with [n8n](https://n8n.io/), experiment with OpenAI, LangChain, and Logic Apps, and share them [right here on GitHub](https://github.com/rrishabhjn).

## 💼 Projects & Repos Worth Exploring

Here are a few projects that reflect my PM thinking, technical fluency, and willingness to get my hands dirty:

- 📦 **n8n Workflows for Personal Productivity Automations** - Personal productivity and SMB growth hacks, stitched together with custom triggers and logic.
- 🛡️ **Access Control Model for Azure BCDR** - Standardized RBAC & control-plane API surface across 5+ workloads, reducing onboarding time by 30%.
- 🧪 **Rapid Prototyping with LangChain & LlamaIndex** - Built internal POCs for startup ideas around document understanding, knowledge graphs, and web scrapers.
- 🧭 **Investor Research Toolkit** - During my MBA, created lightweight GPT-based workflows to vet AI x Infra companies for VC investment based on their community engagement.

## 🧠 My Superpowers

- **Technical Intuition** - I’ve worked with engineers and shipped new products, SDKs, APIs, telemetry systems, and GenAI integrations.
- **Builder Mindset** - Whether it’s a Logic App prototype, Airtable automation, or a pricing model for SaaS, I roll up my sleeves and build.
- **Strategic Rigor** - I’ve driven multi-quarter roadmaps, GTM plans, and customer migration strategies across cloud-scale systems.
- **Curiosity & Hustle** - From exploring distributed systems to building a sold-out **Entrepreneurship Conference** at Kellogg, I chase what excites me.
- **Creative Leadership** - I co-founded Kellogg Masala, a music band born from jam sessions, and received the **Kellogg Leadership Award for Innovation** for my work launching new student ventures and communities.

## 🌍 Beyond the Code

Outside of work, you’ll probably find me:

- 🌍 Traveling solo to places I’ve never been, asking strangers what makes them feel alive.
- 🤿 Exploring the ocean - I’m a certified scuba diver with 35+ dives.
- 🎶 Writing and mixing music - it helps me stay grounded and inspired.
- 🍵 Sipping a cup of Ginger Tea while reading a fiction book.
- 💡 Helping small businesses in my hometown digitize and grow through automation and storytelling.
